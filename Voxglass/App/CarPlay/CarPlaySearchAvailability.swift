/// unsupported template triggers an exception at runtime." On iOS 18 that
/// exception is `CPAssertAllowedClasses` inside `pushTemplate` — an
/// Objective-C exception Swift cannot catch, which is the in-car crash this
/// type exists to prevent. Every search entry point must pass through here;
/// `CarPlaySearchGateContractTests` pins that.
